Use authentication tokens to authenticate Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring API requests, track API usage, and control your use of resources.

Infrastructure Monitoring has two types of tokens:

* :new-page-ref:`User API access tokens <admin-api-access-tokens>` (also known as session tokens). These tokens are valid for a short period.
* :new-page-ref:`Access tokens <admin-org-tokens>` (also known as org tokens). These tokens are valid for an extended period.
