With over two hundred out of the box integrations and dashboards on hybrid cloud infrastructure and infrastructure services, Splunk Observability Cloud lets you to start monitoring, troubleshooting, automating, and collaborating immediately. Speed your cloud journey with a single pain of glass for hybrid coverage. Observability Cloud's cloud-native data and analytics scale is ideal for Kubernetes and highly ephemeral environments. With Splunk Observability Cloud, you can quickly find, analyze, and resolve incidents anywhere in your stack from multicloud to microservices to serverless. Increase reliability and lower your mean time to resolution for all integrated systems. Observability Cloud is the purpose built tool for monitoring, maintaining, and improving system reliability.

Set up Observability Cloud components
=============================================================================================
See :ref:`welcome` for a description of each component in Observability Cloud. With the exception of Log Observer Connect, you must send data from your systems to each Observability Cloud component. You do not need to send your Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise logs to Observability Cloud to analyze them in Log Observer Connect. Instead, see :ref:`logs-scp` or :ref:`logs-set-up-logconnect` to execute the native integration that allows you to analyze your Splunk platform logs in Log Observer Connect without sending them outside of your Splunk platform instance.

For each other Observability Cloud component, see the following pages to send your data to Observability Cloud:

- :ref:`apm`

- :ref:`infrastructure-infrastructure`

- :ref:`logs-set-up-logconnect` (Setup is required, but your logs do not leave your Splunk platform instance.)

- :ref:`rum-setup`

- :ref:`set-up-synthetics`

For an overview of setting up all components and the recommended order of setup, see :ref:`get-started-get-data-in`.

The practice of reliability with Splunk Observability Cloud
==============================================================================================
Five core principles and practices underpin system reliability: availability, performance, monitoring, incident response, and preparation. See :new-page:`What is site reliability engineering? <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-site-reliability-engineering.html#:~:text=Site%20reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20is,production%20systems%20and%20solve%20problems.>` for a deeper understanding of what it takes to achieve reliability in your systems and why Splunk Observability Cloud is the optimal toolset for the job. 

The general principles and practices of reliability fall into four primary categories of tasks:

* :ref:`Monitor SLIs, manage SLOs, and meet SLAs <core2o11y-slis>`

* :ref:`Respond to incidents and write postmortems <core2o11y-incident-response>`

* :ref:`Reduce toil: Automated solutions for interacting with the infrastructure <toil-reduction>`

* :ref:`Collaborate on reliability across teams <toil-reduction>`

Select each of the previous categories to learn how you can execute each major reliability duty efficiently in Observability Cloud.
