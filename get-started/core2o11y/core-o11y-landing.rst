With over two hundred out of the box integrations and dashboards on hybrid cloud infrastructure and infrastructure services, Splunk Observability Cloud lets you to start monitoring, troubleshooting, automating, and collaborating immediately. Speed your cloud journey with a single pain of glass for hybrid coverage. Observability Cloud's cloud-native data and analytics scale is ideal for Kubernetes and highly ephemeral environments. With Splunk Observability Cloud, you can quickly find, analyze, and resolve incidents anywhere in your stack from multicloud to microservices to serverless. Increase reliability and lower your mean time to resolution for all integrated systems. Observability Cloud is the purpose built tool for monitoring, maintaining, and improving system reliability.

Five core principles and practices underpin system reliability: availability, performance, monitoring, incident response, and preparation. See :new-page:`<https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-site-reliability-engineering.html#:~:text=Site%20reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20is,production%20systems%20and%20solve%20problems.>` for a deeper understanding of what it takes to achieve reliability in your systems and why Splunk Observability Cloud is the optimal tool set for the job. The general principles and practices of reliability fall into four primary categories of tasks:

* :ref:`Monitor SLIs, manage SLOs, and meet SLAs <core2o11y-slis>`

* :ref:`Respond to incidents and write postmortems <core2o11y-incident-response>`

* :ref:`Reduce toil: Automated solutions for interacting with the infrastructure <toil-reduction>`

* :ref:`Collaborate on reliability across teams <toil-reduction>`

Select each of the previous categories to learn how you can execute each major reliability duty efficiently in Observability Cloud.
