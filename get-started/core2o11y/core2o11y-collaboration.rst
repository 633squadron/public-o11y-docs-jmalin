   :description: This page provides an overview of how Observability Cloud helps team members collaborate with each other and other teams by sharing dashboards, queries, business workflows, and through alerting.


SREs, developers, operations, and other teams efficiently collaborate in Splunk Observability Cloud by sharing dashboards, charts, queries, and by sending notifications. For more on notifications and alerting, see :ref:`toil-reduction`.
