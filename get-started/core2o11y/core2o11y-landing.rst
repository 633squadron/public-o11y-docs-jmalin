Splunk Observability Cloud puts your Splunk platform logs in context with metrics and traces so that your teams can find, analyze, and resolve incidents anywhere in your stack with a lower mean time to resolution. Observability Cloud provides solutions you need to solve common reliability problems. 

For example, do you have a wide variety of platforms, databases, and cloud services that you must monitor in multiple interfaces? Observability Cloud has hundreds of out of the box integrations that give you a predefined view with a single pane of glass for hybrid coverage.

Are you moving into the cloud and Kubernetes environments, requiring your teams to react to a magnitude of changes very quickly? Observability Cloudâ€™s cloud-native data and analytics scale is built around Kubernetes and highly ephemeral environments. 


Five core principles underpin system reliability: availability, performance, monitoring, incident response, and preparation. See :new-page:`What is site reliability engineering? <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-site-reliability-engineering.html#:~:text=Site%20reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20is,production%20systems%20and%20solve%20problems.>` for a deeper understanding of what it takes to achieve reliability in your systems. 

Anyone can help maintain system reliability using Observability Cloud. The principles of reliability fall into three main categories of practice. Select each of the following categories to learn how you can execute on each major observability practice and maintain reliability with Observability Cloud:

* :ref:`Measure and alert on your SLIs <practice-reliability-slis>`

* :ref:`Respond to incidents <practice-reliability-incident-response>`

* :ref:`Scale your system's reliability by collaborating within and across teams <practice-reliability-collaboration>`


To learn how to set up Observability Cloud, see :ref:`setup-o11y-setup-o11y`. See :ref:`core-to-o11y-faq` to learn about a few differences in how the Splunk platform and Observability Cloud function.
