   Measure and alert on your SLIs <practice-reliability/slis>
   Respond to incidents <practice-reliability/incident-response>
   Scale your system's observability through collaboration <practice-reliability/collaboration>
   Set up Observability Cloud <setup-o11y/setup-o11y>


With the Splunk platform, you can manually perform tasks to maintain or increase the reliability of your systems through Splunk searches and log analysis. With Splunk Observability Cloud, on the other hand, you can:

- Correlate logs with metrics and traces to locate, isolate, and resolve problems in your applications or infrastructure quickly

- Use hundreds of out-of-the-box integrations to start monitoring your entire stack immediately

- Improve mean time to resolution using out of the box and custom alerts and detectors

Observability Cloud is purpose built to solve common system reliability problems. For example, do you have a wide variety of platforms, databases, and cloud services that you must monitor in multiple interfaces? Observability Cloud has hundreds of out of the box integrations that give you a predefined view with a single pane of glass for hybrid coverage.

Are you moving into the cloud and Kubernetes environments, requiring your teams to react to a magnitude of changes very quickly? Observability Cloudâ€™s cloud-native data and analytics scale is built around highly ephemeral environments for Kubernetes and cloud. 


Five core principles underpin system reliability: availability, performance, monitoring, incident response, and preparation. See :new-page:`What is site reliability engineering? <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-site-reliability-engineering.html#:~:text=Site%20reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20is,production%20systems%20and%20solve%20problems.>` for a deeper understanding. But you don't have to be an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) to help maintain system reliability with Observability Cloud. Reliability is essentially 1) measuring your system via its telemetry, 2) alerting you on outages and failures of your infrastructure, and 3) guiding you with dashboards to inform your journey to isolating and resolving problems.
