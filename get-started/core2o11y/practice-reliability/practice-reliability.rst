With over two hundred out of the box integrations and dashboards on hybrid cloud infrastructure and infrastructure services, Splunk Observability Cloud lets you to start monitoring, troubleshooting, automating, and collaborating immediately. Speed your cloud journey with a single pain of glass for hybrid coverage. Observability Cloud's cloud-native data and analytics scale is ideal for Kubernetes and highly ephemeral environments. With Splunk Observability Cloud, you can quickly find, analyze, and resolve incidents anywhere in your stack from multicloud to microservices to serverless. Increase reliability and lower your mean time to resolution for all integrated systems. Observability Cloud is the purpose built tool for monitoring, maintaining, and improving system reliability.

Five core principles and practices underpin system reliability: availability, performance, monitoring, incident response, and preparation. See :new-page:`What is site reliability engineering? <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-site-reliability-engineering.html#:~:text=Site%20reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20is,production%20systems%20and%20solve%20problems.>` for a deeper understanding of what it takes to achieve reliability in your systems and why Splunk Observability Cloud is the optimal toolset for the job. 

The general principles of reliability fall into four main categories of practice. Select each of the following categories to learn how you can execute on each major observability practice and maintain reliability with Observability Cloud:
