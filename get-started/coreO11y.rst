Monitor SLIs, manage SLOs, and meet SLAs
=================================================================================
Splunk Observability Cloud provides out of the box solutions for monitoring SLIs, while allowing you to customize your dashboards, alerts, and detectors to meet your specific SLI, SLO, and SLA needs. Observability Cloud takes the guesswork out of determining error budgets, and helps you set reasonable SLOs, and meet your SLAs. 

The following sections detail the multiple views in Observability Cloud that you can use to track reliability.

Splunk APM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Splunk APM automatically generates a service map displaying all of your instrumented and inferred services, the dependencies among them, and SLIs for each when you click into a service. See :ref:`apm-service-map`. Defining and managing SLOs for services with dependencies, some of which have their own SLOs, is tricky. A dynamically generated service map showing all integrated services and dependencies helps you decide if and how to combine SLOs for multiple dependencies.

:ref:`data-visualization-built-in-dashboards` in Splunk APM are automatically populated with SLIs for all integrated services. See :ref:`data-visualization-dashboards` for a list of types of dashboards and how you can create, customize, import, export, clone, and share them. See :ref:`apm-apm-alert-visualization-apm-dashboards` to learn how to track performance, troubleshoot from the dashboard, and finally create a detector so that you can alert on a dashboard or chart in the future.
