   :description: Use services to organize incidents depending on the impacted environmental component.

Use services to organize incidents depending on the impacted environmental component. Begin by creating a service. Then, route alerts to the service. Next, specify which alerts create an incident and how alerts are grouped into incidents. Finally, create incident workflows with escalating steps to determine who is notified to respond when a new incident is triggered.
