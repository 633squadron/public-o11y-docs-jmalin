   :description: Steps to reassign a full on-call shift or parts of a shift.
   
You can reassign full or partial on-call shifts to other responders if you are unable to be on on-call. Alternatively, you can also take a current or future shift from someone. This is helpful if the current on-call responder is unable to reassign the shift themselves, for example during an emergency.
