   :description: Steps to reassign a full on-call shift or parts of a shift.
   
You can reassign full or partial on-call shifts to other team members if you are unable to be on on-call. Alternatively, you can also take a current or future shift from someone. This is helpful if the current on-call responder is unable to reassign the shift themselves, for example during an emergency.

There are two ways to reassign shifts, depending on what page you are viewing in Incident Intelligence:

* From the main Incident Intelligence page, select :guilabel:`On-call Schedule`. In the side-pane that opens, select :guilabel:`Reassign Shift`.
* From the Incident Management page, select the :guilabel:`On-call schedules` tab, then :guilabel:`Reassign shift`

Reassign a full or partial shift
========================================

If you are unable to complete a current or upcoming shift, you can reassign all or part of that shift to another team member. You can reassign one hour increments if needed, for example if you have an appointment. You can reassign one of your own shifts or reassign someone else's shift for them.

To reassign a shift follow these steps: 

#. Do one of the following:
   * On the main Incident Intelligence page, select :guilabel:`On-call Schedule`. In the side-pane that opens, select :guilabel:`Reassign Shift`.
   * On the Incident Management page, select the :guilabel:`On-call schedules` tab, then :guilabel:`Reassign shift`
#. On the Reassign Shifts window, select the time range you are unavailable including the dates and times.
#. (Optional) If required, enter the name of the shift owner. The default is set to the current user.
#. Select :guilabel:`Search for schedules` to find the shift to reassign. Any shifts impacted by the time frame you selected display. 
#. In :guilabel:`Reassign to`, enter the name of the team member who will take the shift or partial shift. 
#. Save your changes.

In the updated schedule, the shift or partial shift that was reassigned is now assigned to the new team member. Additionally, there is a notation of from whom the shift was reassigned.
