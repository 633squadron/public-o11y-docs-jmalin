   * - :strong:`Concept`
     - :strong:`Description`
   
   * - Acknowledged
     - Incident responders select this status to indicate that they are aware of the incident. The status lifecycle for incidents is triggered, then acknowledged, and then resolved. Acknowledging an incident prevents the escalation to the next step in an incident workflow.

   * - Alert grouping
     - Use alert grouping to automate incident trigger conditions and group alerts. Alert grouping conditions are set up at the service level to let you customize the grouping rules for each service. 

   * - Alert routing
     - Alert routing associates alerts with a service. If an alert matches your configured alert routing conditions, it is routed to the service.

   * - Incident response configuration
     - The entire configuration process for a service in Incident Intelligence. This is where you create a service and configure alert routing, alert grouping, and incident workflows for incidents associated with a service. 

   * - Incidents
     - An unplanned interruption to a service or reduction in the quality of a service. Not all alerts are incidents. Each incident is made up of alerts or events that are ingested into Incident Intelligence.

   * - Incident action
     - Any status-changing event taken by a user or the system on an incident. Incident responders can acknowledge, resolve, or reject an incident. These actions update the incident status to reflect the most recent action. 

   * - Incident status
     - Where an incident is in its lifecycle. The status of an incident changes based on alert grouping conditions, as well as actions from a user. Throughout the lifecycle of an incident, the incident status can go from triggered, to acknowledged, to resolved or rejected. 

   * - Incident workflow
     - A configurable series of escalation steps that run in response to a triggered incident. Incident workflows determine who is notified of an incident and the time interval for notifications. You can also use incident workflows to manage how incidents are routed, add automation steps, and route to an on-call schedule.

   * - Incident alerting
     - The primary mechanism of Incident Intelligence. It is the process by which alerts and events are ingested at scale and grouped to create incidents. As alerts and events are ingested into Incident Intelligence, they pass through a series of data transformations, such as alert routing and alert grouping. 

   * - On-call schedules
     - An on-call schedule consists of one or more shifts, with members who rotate through a shift. Use an on-call schedule as a step in your services' incident workflows.

   * - Rejected
     - An incident status that incident responders can set to indicate that the incident is rejected. The status lifecycle for incidents is triggered, then acknowledged, and then resolved. Setting an incident status to rejected prevents the escalation to the next step in an incident workflow.

   * - Resolved
     - An incident status that incident responders set to indicate that the incident is resolved. The status lifecycle for incidents is triggered, then acknowledged, and then resolved. Resolving an incident status prevents the escalation to the next step in an incident workflow.

   * - Service-based routing
     - Incident Intelligence relies on a service-based routing scheme. Service-based routing automatically organizes and routes incidents depending on the service that itâ€™s impacting. Rather than routing to a combination of teams and policies, the service an incident is associated with determines who is notified of the incident. 

   * - Splunk Incident Intelligence
     - Splunk Incident Intelligence lets IT and DevOps SREs resolve outages with event correlation, incident response, on-call routing, collaboration, and automation. Incident Intelligence provides organizations with a way to manage both their ITOps and DevOps environments by providing a collaborative ChatOps interface. This interface lets SREs and IT Operations teams collaborate to diagnose and remediate issues and across their environment. Incident Intelligence uses event, incident, and diagnosis data to provide insights and recommendations to the SREs and operators to address similar issues in the future.

   * - Triggered
     - The initial stage of an incident is triggered. Incidents are triggered based on the alert grouping conditions you configured for the service.
