Ingest alerts
************************************************************************

Incident Intelligence ingests alerts from the following Observability Cloud event sources.

- Splunk APM
- Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring
- Splunk NPM

To ingest alerts into Incident Intelligence, you have to define a detector for the available event sources and route that detector to a service in Incident Intelligence. See :ref:`get-started-detectoralert` for more information about configuring detectors. See :ref:`create-service` and :ref:`configure-alert-routing` for steps to create a service and route alerts to the service.
