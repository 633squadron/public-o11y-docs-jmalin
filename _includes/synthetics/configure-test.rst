Customize your test details
------------------------------

Use these steps to customize your test configuration and finish creating your test: 

#. In the :guilabel:`Locations` field, enter the locations from which you want to test the URL. You can select one or multiple locations. 
#. In the :guilabel:`Device Type` field, use the list to select the device from which you'd like to conduct the test. 
#. In the :guilabel:`Frequency` field, select your desired test frequency from the list. 
#. (Optional) Use the :guilabel:`Round Robin` selector to switch between options: enabling Round Robin means your test cycles through your selected locations one at a time, while disabling Round Robin runs the test from all selected locations concurrently at your selected frequency. 
#. If you want to receive alerts from this test, select :guilabel:`+ Create detector` to set up a detector on the test. Use the dialog box to customize your detector. 
#. Select :guilabel:`Submit`. This redirects you to the Test History page for your new test. If you've just created the test, allow at least one test frequency interval for your test to begin collecting synthetic data. 
#. (Optional) Select :guilabel:`Edit test` or the three-dot :guilabel:`Actions` menu in the row for your test to edit, pause, duplicate, or delete this test.
