   :description: Manually instrument your Go application when you need to add custom attributes to spans or want to manually generate spans.

Instrumenting applications automatically using the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Go covers most needs. Manually instrumenting your application is only necessary when, for example, you need to add custom attributes to spans or need to manually generate spans.

For instructions on how to manually instrument Go applications, see the Manual instrumentation docs in the OpenTelemetry Go Instrumentation repository at https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/manual/.

.. note:: Manual OTel instrumentation is fully compatible with Splunk instrumentation and is fully supported by Splunk.
