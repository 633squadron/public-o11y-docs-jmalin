  :description: Search logs by keyword

You can drill down in logs by searching for keywords. To search by keyword,
follow these steps:

#. In the Filter bar next to the time picker, add a new search by clicking :guilabel:`+`.
#. Type the keyword or phrase you want to search on, then press Enter.
#. To continue adding keywords to the search, click :guilabel:`+`.

The Timeline and Raw Logs Table now display only the log events that contain the
keywords you entered. You can continue to add keywords without limit.

If you can't think of keywords to use, group log records using aggregations with
statistical analysis. Based on the analysis, identify frequently-repeated words or
phrases in as keywords. To learn more, see
